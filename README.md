# IncomePredict: A Simple Data Science Project

**IncomePredict** is a lightweight, **Python-based** data science project focused on **predicting income levels** using **data visualization, encoding techniques, and machine learning models**.

---

## Background

### Why Income?
#### **Primary Indicator**
Income is a **primary indicator** of well-being in our daily lives, helping to meet our essential needs.

#### **Various Factors**
Income levels are shaped by various factors that influence their distribution among individuals.

#### **Impact**
Researching income-influencing factors deepens our understanding of their impact and effectiveness.

## Features

### 1. **Data Visualization & Insights**
   - Generate graphical representations of income distribution.
   - Understand key variables affecting income levels.

### 2. **Encoding & Decoding**
   - **Ordinal Encoding** for ordered categorical variables.
   - **One-Hot Encoding** for categorical variables with no inherent order.

### 3. **K-Fold Cross-Validation Prediction**
   - Use **K-Fold cross-validation** to enhance model performance.
   - Evaluate model accuracy with **recall and precision metrics**.

### 4. **Basic Data Merging & Splitting**
   - Combine multiple datasets.
   - Perform train-test splits for machine learning models.
